    "The code defines a Python program containing a function and two classes. Let's break down each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `getCurrentTime()` Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `getCurrentTime` uses Python's `datetime` module to fetch the current date and time, formats it as a string (e.g., \"MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS\"), and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def getCurrentTime():\n",
    "    return datetime.now().strftime(\"%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Messenger` Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a base class for a simple messaging system. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: The constructor initializes an instance of the `Messenger` class with an optional `listeners` argument, which should be a list of objects that can receive messages. By default, this is an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `send`: This method takes a message and forwards it to all the \"listeners\" in its list by calling their `receive` method. Essentially, it \"sends\" the message to each listener.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `receive`: This is a placeholder method meant to be overridden by subclasses. It's supposed to handle a received message, but in the base class, it doesn't do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Messenger:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, listeners=[]):\n",
    "        self.listeners = listeners\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def send(self, message):\n",
    "        for listener in self.listeners:\n",
    "            listener.receive(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def receive(self, message):\n",
    "        # Must be implemented by extending classes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SaveMessages` Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an empty class that inherits from `Messenger`. The comment \"# Your code here!\" suggests that this class is intended to be filled out with additional behavior, possibly to save messages in some manner. Since it's empty and doesn't override anything, it would behave exactly like `Messenger` as it stands.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SaveMessages(Messenger):\n",
    "    # Your code here!\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it's Supposed to Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can create an instance of the `Messenger` class and optionally pass in \"listeners,\" which should be objects that have a `receive` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you call the `send` method on a `Messenger` instance, it iterates through all its listeners and calls their `receive` methods, passing along the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `SaveMessages` class is meant to extend `Messenger` and presumably add functionality to save messages, but as of now, it doesn't do anything special.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `receive` method in `Messenger` is intentionally left empty for subclasses to implement their own message-receiving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can extend a class by creating a new class that inherits from an existing class. The existing class is known as the \"base class\" or \"parent class,\" and the new class is known as the \"derived class\" or \"child class.\" You can use the `super()` function to call methods from the parent class within the child class. Here's a basic example to illustrate the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent Class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Some generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child Class extending Parent Class\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call parent constructor to set 'name'\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Overriding the parent method\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof, woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Fido\", \"Labrador\")\n",
    "my_dog.make_sound()  # Output: Woof, woof!\n",
    "print(my_dog.name)   # Output: Fido\n",
    "print(my_dog.breed)  # Output: Labrador\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `Animal` class is the parent class with a constructor (`__init__`) and a method (`make_sound`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `Dog` class is the child class that extends `Animal`. It has its own constructor that calls the parent constructor using `super().__init__(name)` to set the `name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `Dog` class overrides the `make_sound` method from the `Animal` class to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When an object of the `Dog` class is created and its `make_sound` method is called, the overridden method in the `Dog` class is executed, not the one in the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By extending classes, you can reuse and extend functionality while adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming like inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defines a basic messaging system using classes in Python. Let's break down the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `getCurrentTime()`: This function returns the current date and time as a formatted string. It uses the `datetime` class from Python's `datetime` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Messenger`: This is a base class with an `__init__` method to initialize a list of \"listeners\" (other `Messenger` objects that should receive messages). It has a `send` method to send messages to all the listeners, and an empty `receive` method, which should be implemented by classes that extend `Messenger`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `SaveMessages`: This class is supposed to extend `Messenger` but hasn't been implemented yet. The comment `# Your code here!` suggests that you should add code here.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The last part of the code creates an instance of the `SaveMessages` class called `listener`, and another instance of the `Messenger` class called `sender`. The `sender` is initialized with `listener` in its list of listeners. Then, a message is sent through `sender`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code to be functional, you'd need to implement the `SaveMessages` class to handle the receiving of messages, possibly saving them somewhere. Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "def getCurrentTime():\n",
    "    return datetime.now().strftime(\"%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Messenger:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, listeners=[]):\n",
    "        self.listeners = listeners\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def send(self, message):\n",
    "        for listener in self.listeners:\n",
    "            listener.receive(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def receive(self, message):\n",
    "        # Must be implemented by extending classes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class SaveMessages(Messenger):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__()  # Initialize with the parent's __init__ method\n",
    "        self.saved_messages = []  # List to save received messages\n",
    "\n",
    "    def receive(self, message):\n",
    "        current_time = getCurrentTime()\n",
    "        self.saved_messages.append(f\"{current_time}: {message}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Message received and saved at {current_time}: {message}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run this cell after you've written your solution\n",
    "listener = SaveMessages()\n",
    "\n",
    "sender = Messenger([listener])\n",
    "\n",
    "sender.send('Hello, there! This is the first message')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extended version, the `SaveMessages` class inherits from `Messenger` and overrides its `receive` method. When a message is received, it is saved into a `saved_messages` list along with the current time."
