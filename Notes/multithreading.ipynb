    "Multithreading is a way to run multiple threads (smaller units of a program) in parallel. In Python, the `threading` module provides a way to create and manage threads. Note that because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython (the standard and most widely-used Python interpreter), true parallel execution of Python code may not be achieved with threads. However, they are still useful for I/O-bound tasks and for achieving concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example that demonstrates how to use the `threading` module to run two functions in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",

    "\n",
    "# Function to print numbers from 0 to 9\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",

    "        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming task\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to print letters from 'a' to 'j'\n",
    "def print_letters():\n",
    "    for letter in 'abcdefghij':\n",
    "        time.sleep(1.5)  # Simulate a time-consuming task\n",
    "        print(letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create two threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)\n",

    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Both threads are done!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define two functions: `print_numbers()` and `print_letters()`. Each function prints 10 items, pausing for 1 or 1.5 seconds between each print statement to simulate some time-consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create two threads, one for each function, using `threading.Thread(target=function_name)`. Calling `start()` on a thread object starts the execution of the function in a new thread. The `join()` method makes sure the main program waits for these threads to finish execution before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this code, and you'll see numbers and letters being printed interchangeably, demonstrating that the two functions are running concurrently."

    "Here's a line-by-line explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `def longSquare(num, results):` defines a function that takes a number `num` and a dictionary `results` as arguments.\n",
    "2. `time.sleep(1)` simulates a delay of 1 second to mimic a \"long-running\" task.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. `threads = [threading.Thread(target=longSquare, args=(n, results)) for n in range(0, 100)]` uses list comprehension to create 100 threads. Each thread will execute the `longSquare` function with a unique value of `n` and the shared `results` dictionary as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `[t.start() for t in threads]` starts all the threads. This line uses list comprehension as a shorthand to call the `start()` method on each thread object in the `threads` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `[t.join() for t in threads]` waits for all the threads to complete their execution. Again, list comprehension is used to call the `join()` method on each thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `print(results)` prints the `results` dictionary, which now should contain squares of numbers from 0 to 99 as key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's worth mentioning that using a shared mutable object (`results` dictionary in this case) across multiple threads can lead to data races. For a production-level code, consider using locks or other synchronization mechanisms."
