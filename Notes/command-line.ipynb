    "(env) nickhuemmer@Nicks-Mac-mini Notes % python3 writefile.py -h                   \n",

    "  -h, --help     show this help message and exit\n",

    "### Importing Necessary Module\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from argparse import ArgumentParser\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we're importing the `ArgumentParser` class from the `argparse` module. This module is used to write user-friendly command-line interfaces. The `ArgumentParser` class will hold all the information necessary to parse the command-line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing the Argument Parser\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parser = ArgumentParser()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates an instance of the `ArgumentParser` class which will allow us to add arguments we expect the user to provide when they run our script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Arguments\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parser.add_argument('--output', '-o', required=True,\n",
    "                    help='the destination file for the output of this program')\n",
    "parser.add_argument('--text', '-t', required=True,\n",
    "                    help='The text to write to the files')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We're adding two arguments here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `--output` (with a short version `-o`): This argument expects the user to provide the path of the destination file where the output (or text) of this program should be written. The `required=True` means that the user must provide this argument when running the script. The `help` parameter gives a brief description of the argument's purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `--text` (with a short version `-t`): This argument expects the user to provide the text that should be written to the file specified by the `--output` argument. Again, it is a required argument and has a description provided in the `help` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsing the Arguments\n",
    "```python\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line parses the arguments provided by the user. Once parsed, the arguments can be accessed as attributes of the `args` object. For example, `args.output` would give the value the user provided for the `--output` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing to the File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(args.output, 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write(args.text+'\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "This part uses the built-in `open` function to create (or overwrite if it exists) a file with the name/path specified by `args.output`. The `'w'` means the file is opened in write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `with` block, the provided text (from `args.text`) is written to the file. The `+'\\n'` adds a newline at the end of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing Confirmation to Console\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f'Wrote \"{args.text}\" to file {args.output}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, a formatted string is printed to the console confirming the text that was written and the file it was written to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This script is designed to be run from the command line and takes two arguments: the text to write and the file to which the text should be written. The argparse module ensures that the user provides both pieces of information and then the script writes the text to the specified file."
