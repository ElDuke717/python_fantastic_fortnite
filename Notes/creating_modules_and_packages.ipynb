    "### Modules and Packages in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Modules:**\n",
    "A module is simply a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "Let's assume we have a file named `math_operations.py` with the following content:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "def subtract(a, b):\n",
    "    return a - b\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can import this module in another Python script using the `import` statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math_operations\n",
    "\n",
    "result = math_operations.add(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Packages:**\n",
    "A package is a way of organizing related modules into a single directory hierarchy. Essentially, it's a directory that contains multiple module files and a special `__init__.py` file to let Python know that the directory should be treated as a package or submodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "Consider a directory named `calculations` and it contains two module files `math_operations.py` and `trigonometry.py` and an `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directory structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "calculations/\n",
    "|-- __init__.py\n",
    "|-- math_operations.py\n",
    "|-- trigonometry.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can organize and access these modules using the package:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from calculations import math_operations\n",
    "\n",
    "result = math_operations.add(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import calculations.math_operations\n",
    "\n",
    "result = calculations.math_operations.add(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Modules and Packages:\n",
    "- **Modularity:** You can separate your code into different modules based on functionality.\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Modules and packages can be reused across multiple projects.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Organized code is easier to manage and update.\n",
    "- **Namespacing:** Packages provide a way of grouping related modules and avoiding naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important points:\n",
    "- The `__init__.py` file can be empty, but it needs to be present for Python to recognize the directory as a package.\n",
    "- You can also define variables, functions, or classes inside `__init__.py` if you want them to be available when the package is imported.\n",
    "- Python comes with a plethora of built-in modules (like `os`, `sys`, `math`, etc.) and has an extensive ecosystem of third-party packages that can be installed using tools like `pip`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
